# deep-learning-challenge
Using multiple hidden layers and the “RELU” function I created a model a neural network model showing the loss and Accuracy. 
I changed the density and reduced the number of epochs but was not able to score an accuracy rating above the desired 75% threshold.  With an attempt 2 of 50 epochs scoring a=  72.47 score and attempt 1 with 100 epochs scoring a 67.2 rating. 

Adding additional layers may have changed this score and could have been used as both models contained 2 hidden layers. Decreasing the density and reducing the epochs did improve the accuracy so it is possible if I kept reducing the density the accuracy score would of hit the 75% threshhold
